		"Hi Stranger! You're about to enter a groupchat. All you have to do is to look intelligent and respect others. If you're up for this little challenge, type 'I agree'."
		"Hi there! You've been selected out of thousands of options to enter an elite groupchat: You just have to look intelligent (-ish) and respect others. If you accept these terms, please type 'I agree'."
		"Eh? How did you get here? This is the doorway to a world of incredible conversations, if you think you're up to it, type 'I agree'. Otherwise, return to your hobbit hole."

	challengeAccept: [

		"Why did you accept? We said intelligent, y'know? Now good luck figuring your nickname."
		"Welcome to our world. You'll have to talk to make the promises true, though. Mission zero: figure your nickname out."
		"Well, that's the first challenge passed. Your IQ is definitely over 50. Sadly, 51 might earn you a kick pretty sharpish. Prove your worth by figuring your nickname."
		"Usually, that would earn you a place amongst us. But we don't like you, so we gave you a silly nickname. Guess what."
